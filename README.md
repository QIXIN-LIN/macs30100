# MACS30100: Winter 2024 Personal Course Repository  

This is my personal repository for the **MACS30100 Perspectives on Computational Modeling** course in Winter 2024. It contains all the notebooks, assignments, quizzes, and project files Iâ€™ve worked on throughout the course. This repository serves as a centralized space for my learning journey and project work.

## Repository Structure  

### 1. `class-notebook`  
This folder contains all the in-class notebooks and examples provided during the course:  
- **`M1_1_EDA.ipynb`**: Exploratory Data Analysis notebook.  
- **`M1_2_data_processing.ipynb`**: Data preprocessing workflows.  
- **`M2_1_DT_inclass.ipynb`**: Introduction to Decision Trees.  
- **`M2_2_Linear_inclass.ipynb`**: Linear model implementation.  
- **`M3_2_validation_practices.ipynb`**: Validation techniques for model performance.  
- **`M3_3_ensemble_practices.ipynb`**: Working with ensemble models.  
- **`M4_1_clustering_practices.ipynb`**: Unsupervised clustering techniques.  
- **`M4_2_PCA_practices.ipynb`**: Dimensionality reduction with PCA.  
- **`M5_1_DL_workflow.ipynb`**: Deep learning model workflows.  
- **`M5_2_DL_for_CV.ipynb`**: Applying DL for computer vision tasks.  
- **`M5_3_DL_for_text.ipynb`**: Using DL techniques for text analysis.

### 2. `class-quiz`  
Notebooks for quizzes that help reinforce the concepts covered in the course.  
- `Q2_1_DT.ipynb`: Quiz on Decision Trees.  
- `Q2_2_linear.ipynb`: Quiz on Linear Models.

### 3. `modeling-project`  
This folder contains notebooks for my main course project.  
- `P1_EDA.ipynb`: Initial exploratory data analysis.  
- `P2_1_DT.ipynb` & `P2_2_linear.ipynb`: Decision Tree and Linear Model implementations for the project.  
- `P3_evaluation.ipynb`: Model evaluation and performance assessment.  
- `P4_unsupervised.ipynb`: Exploration of unsupervised learning techniques.  
- `project_proposal.md`: My project proposal for the course project.

### 4. `README.md`  
This file, which provides an overview of the repository.

## Purpose  

This repository is for personal use as I navigate the MACS30100 course. It includes:  
- Lecture materials and exercises.  
- Assignments and quizzes for self-assessment.  
- A hands-on project to apply course concepts.

## Notes  

- All code and files are my personal work, created for learning purposes during the course.  
- Please reach out to me directly if you have questions about the work in this repository.
